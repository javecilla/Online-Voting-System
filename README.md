# About
The journey of the Golden Minds Colleges Online Voting System began in 2023 with the development and launch of our first online voting system for the Santa Maria Teen Model 2023, followed by the successful implementation for Buwan ng Wikang Pambansa: Lakan, Lakambini at Lakandyosa 2023. Since then, as the lead developer, I have remained committed to providing a seamless and reliable platform for democratic participation.
